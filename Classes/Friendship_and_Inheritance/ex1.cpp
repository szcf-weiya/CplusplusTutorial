/*************************************************************
In principle, private and protected members of a class cannot be accessed from outside the same class in which they are declared. However, this rule does not apply to "friends".

Friends are functions or classes declared with the friend keyword.

A non-member function can access the private and protected members of a class if it is declared a friend of that class. That is done by including a declaration of this external function within the class, and preceding it with the keyword friend:

# include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
  int width, height;
public:
  Rectangle() {}
  Rectangle(int x, int y) : width(x), height(y) {}
  int area() {return width * height;}
  friend Rectangle duplicate (const Rectangle&);
};

Rectangle duplicate (const Rectangle& param)
{
  Rectangle res;
  res.width = param.width*2;
  res.height = param.height*2;
  return res;
}

int main()
{
  Rectangle foo;
  Rectangle bar (2, 3);
  foo = duplicate(bar);
  cout << foo.area() << '\n';
  return 0;
}
